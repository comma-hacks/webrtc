For the signaling server I am using an existing system I have created for password injection.

It is not open source, but now I have open-sourced a python signaling implementation in this repo.

The service is public access. You can get the iPhone app from here, although at the time of this writing I have not yet published the video streaming support. I will have to cut a release later and publish to app store.

When you start the webrtc server it will show you a QR code that you can scan with the SecurePut app. At this point you will see your device and be able to connect.
